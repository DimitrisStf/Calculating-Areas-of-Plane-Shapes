# Calculating-Areas-of-Plane-Shapes
A Java program that calculates the area of six geometric shapes: Triangle, Circle, Parallelogram, Trapezoid, Ellipse, and Regular Polygon. Users can input the required dimensions, and the program returns the calculated area. This project is a simple exercise in Java methods, user input/output, and applying geometric formulas.
