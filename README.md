# Calculating Areas of Plane Shapes üìêüü†

This Java program allows users to calculate the area of six common 2D shapes: Rectangle, Triangle, Circle, Regular Polygon, Ellipse, and Trapezoid. Users interact with a simple text-based menu where they can select a shape, enter the required dimensions, and immediately see the calculated area. For circles, the program also provides the circumference. The menu loops continuously until the user chooses to exit, offering a smooth and user-friendly experience.

The program is built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Each shape is represented by a separate class (e.g., Rectangle, Triangle, Circle, RegularPolygon, Ellipse, Trapezoid) that contains fields for the dimensions and methods to calculate the area. The Circle class additionally includes a method to calculate the circumference. This modular approach ensures that the code is easy to maintain, extend, and reuse for future projects.

User input is handled using the Scanner class, and all inputs are validated to ensure that dimensions are positive numbers. The main class, SHAPEAREA2D, manages the menu, collects user input, and calls the appropriate methods from each shape class. The program also uses loops, conditionals, and formatted output (printf) to deliver clear and accurate results to the user.

This project demonstrates practical Java skills, including creating classes and methods, handling user input, applying geometric formulas, and implementing input validation. It is ideal for beginners or intermediate learners looking to practice object-oriented programming, problem-solving, and applying math concepts in code. Additionally, the program can be easily extended to include more shapes, additional calculations, or enhanced user interfaces.

Last but not least, is not only a useful tool for learning and practicing Java programming but can also be used by students for school projects, homework, or simply to explore geometric concepts in a practical way. It combines programming skills with math learning, making it a versatile educational resource.
